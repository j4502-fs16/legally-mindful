  <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
  <p>Mindfulness is the ability to be in the present moment fully, intentionally, and non-judgmentally. Practicing mindfulness cultivates many skills and mental qualities that can be helpful to those in the legal profession, including the ability to focus and concentrate, recognize and let go of distractions, and accept oneself and others openly and compassionately. Mindful practice in this context includes secular meditation and mindfulness in all of its forms, and specifically mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) meditation techniques. For a comprehensive discussion, see Leonard L. Riskin, The Contemplative Lawyer: On the Potential Contributions of Mindfulness Meditation to Law Students, Lawyers, and their Clients, 7. Harv. Neg. L. Rev. 1 (2002). </p>

  <h2>What is new in mindfulness?</h2>
  <p>Mindfulness is a commonly expanding field and has been spreading rapidly through the legal community in the past few years. This will be continually updated as changes come in, and links to their blog. </p>

  <h2>How do I get involved?</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the Mindfulness in Law Society page. We are currently working on setting up and will have helpful links and information soon. Thanks for stopping by. This will link to the members page, which has options depending on whether you are a law student, law professor, lawyer, judge, etc. They're still working on this though, so right now there's no actual content for that. </p>
