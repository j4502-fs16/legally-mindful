<h2> Create Your Program</h2>
</div>

<p> Creating a Mindfulness in Law Society chapter is much easier with support from your law schools’ administration. The links below offer guidance on how to approach your administration about starting a mindfulness program. Additional resources listed below provide studies and articles for why your administration or potential faculty advisors should support a Mindfulness in Law Society at your law school. </p>

<p> This video by Professor Scott Rodgers offers a brief explanation of what Mindfulness is and how it can benefit the practice of law.</p>


<h5>Introduction to Mindfulness Powerpoint</h5>

<p> <a href="MindingLaw.pptx"> This powerpoint by Tulane Law Professor Pamela R. Metzger </a> is an excellent resource to introduce the benefits of mindful practice to student groups and administration. The presentation includes a list of law schools with existing Mindfulness programs, law review articles discussing the benefits of mindfulness, and more.</p>

<h5>Cure for the Distracted Mind: Why Law Schools Should Teach Mindfulness</h5>

<p> <a target="blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2474338">This law review article by Shailini George</a> offers a convincing explanation of why Mindfulness should be taught in law schools.  If your administration is skeptical of the Mindfulness’ relevance for law students consider forwarding this article along with your student-organization proposal.</p> -->

<h2>Meet Your University’s Requirements</h2>

<h5>Start Your MILS Chapter</h5>

<p><a target="_blank" href="StartMILS.pdf"> Here is a start guide.</a> MILS encourages students to create an official organization within their university to promote administrative support and acquire funding for speakers and retreats.  Often universities require new student organizations to create bylaws and a constitution. We have provided an easy template for you to write your own Mindfulness in Law Society chapter bylaws and constitution.</p>

<h4>MILS Sample Statement of Purpose</h4>

<p>Universities also often ask for a statement of purpose, and <a href="MLS-Sample-Statement.docx"> this sample statement of purpose </a>provides you with a starting point for how to draft your own statement of purpose.</p>

<h5>Building a Mindfulness in Law Program</h5>

<p>At the 2013 Workshop on Mindfulness in Legal Education at Berkeley Law, Charlie Halpern, Director of the Berkeley Initiative for Mindfulness in Law, discusses the process of developing a comprehensive mindfulness program in a law school, including gaining administrative support, financial backing, and generating student interest.</p>
